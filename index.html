    <h2>Teaching</h2>
    <p>
        Over the past 9 years, I have had the pleasure to teach a broad range of topics to a handful of students all across the world. Not only have I taught independently, but I have also worked with for- and non-profits to provide high-quality instruction to students.<br>
        <br>
        Currently, I work for an education company (<a href="https://zinkerz.com/">Zinkerz</a>) which provides academic support to students all over the world but particularly to South American students. For the 2021-2022 academic season, I am teaching both <strong>Calculus AB</strong> and <strong>Calculus BC</strong> group lectures on top of some individual classes in Pre-Calculus and Calculus.<br>
